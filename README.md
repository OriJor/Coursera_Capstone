This is the capstone project for IBM data science professional courses

## Introduction/Buisness Problem

The world as a whole suffers due to car accidents, including the USA. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the USA suggests that the economical and societal harm from car accidents can cost up to $871 billion in a single year. The project aims to understand, study and predict the severity of accidents and the external factors that can play a role such as the weather, the road and light conditions. 

This model can be used for alerting drivers when the probability of having a severe accident is high.
